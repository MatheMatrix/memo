Skipped release because of unrecognized version in RPCs.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fix error report generation.

## [0.9.0] 2017-10-19

Node churn intensive testing and rebalancing robustification.

### Added

- Add `--resign-on-shutdown` option to rebalance all blocks to other
  nodes on exit.
- Prometheus gauges for reachable blocks and under-replicated blocks.
- Add centralized crash reporting.
- Option `--log` to control the generated logs.

### Changed

- Fix Koordinate overlay cleanup that did not cleanup underlying
  overlays.
- Handle consecutive rebalancing.
- Rebalance blocks when a peer evicts itself from the quorum.
- Propagate block value if several nodes conflicted during
  rebalancing.
- When reading, be resilient to a minority of node missing a block.
- Transmit immutable block ownership information to new node holding
  them so they can handle replication themselves.

  interface.
- Various minor issues in the command-line parsing.

## [0.8.0] 2017-05-22

Kouncil improvements and completion, gRPC interface for the KV store,
basic prometheus monitoring.

### Added

- gRPC interface to the key-value store using the `--grpc` option.
- Prometheus-compatible metrics collection endpoint using the
  `--prometheus` option.
- Add a software TCP heartbeat to detect and drop TCP connection stale
  at the OS level.
- Enable nodes to advertise they won't store any more block for now.
- The option `--peer` now attempts to connect to all the machines
  matching the address.
- Some cryptographic features can be disabled at network creation time:
  filesystem at-rest encryption (--disable-encrypt-at-rest), RPC encryption
  (--disable-encrypt-rpc), and signature computation/validation
  (--disable-signature).
- Add `--grpc-port-file` option to `infinit network run` to store the port
  the gRPC server is listening on to disk.

### Changed

- In Kouncil, also retry connecting if the very first connection
  attempt fails.
- In Kouncil, preserve endpoints and try reconnecting for a certain
  time after a peer disappear.
- Guarantee only one connection is opened to any peer.
- Prefer `--silo` over `--storage` everywhere relevant, e.g.
  `infinit network create --silo SILO --name NAME`.
- Change silo creation CLI to make the silo type a subcommand instead
  of an option: `infinit silo create TYPE OPTIONS`.
- Changed CLI options `--stats` into `--stat` for consistency.
- The RPC server can now optionally serve RPCs in parallel. Enable by
  setting the value of INFINIT_RPC_SERVE_THREADS to 0 for unlimited, or
  N for a limit of N parallel tasks.
- Reading CHB (immutable blocks) now balances the reads between the available
  servers based on number of transfers running.
- In the filesystem, removing big files is now much faster than before.

### Fixed

- Fix several memory errors on shutdown.
- In Kouncil, advertise removed blocks to other nodes.
- Repair legacy binaries for backward compatibility
  (e.g., `infinit-volume` instead of the current `infinit volume`).
- In Kouncil, passing multiple --peer to the command line now works as expected.
- In Kouncil, fix a bug that caused `infinit network` to abort when the
  initialization RPC failed.
- Error messages from the CLI are more consistent.
- In Kelips, clients (nodes not providing storage) are now properly notified
  of new peers and peer endpoint changes.
- In Cache, fix handling of `--cache-ram-size=0` volume option: do not cache
  any mutable block.
- In the filesystem, disable directory prefetching tasks if `--cache`
  is disabled.
- In the CLI, `--protocol` option is now properly handled by
  `infinit network create`
