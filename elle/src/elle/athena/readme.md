# Athena

Athena is a byzantine environment library, providing tools to establish quorums and reach consensuses.

> This library is part of the [Elle](https://github.com/infinit/elle) set of libraries.

## Motivation

[Elle](https://github.com/infinit/elle) was originally designed to be the core library of [infinit](https://github.com/infinit/fs), a distributed file system. Athena contains the abstraction for consensus algorithms, like [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)).
